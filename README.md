Updated Image Classifier


This is the mushroom image classifier repo that is pushed to Heroku for deployment. This application was rewritten, initial version deleted from Heroku. Please refer to 
my other repo for a more updated version: https://github.com/Jugarcia15/Streamlit-Mushroom-Image-Classifier.git.
The Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab Notebook will be uploaded at a later date.


This is the initial version of the Mushroom image Classifier. 
There is a different implementation utilizing Gradio rather than Streamlit. 
To be uploaded as a seperate repository at a later date.
